		<h1>Setting up Your Mod Framework</h1>
		<hr/
        <p>
            Before I can teach you how to create cool things like custom items, blocks and mobs, we first need to create a skeletal structure for your first upcoming mod. This kind of structure is commonly refer to as a mod framework. The goal of this structure is
            to deploy a simple modding environment that will be directly connected with Forge API. This environment should be very generic in it's design and should not reflect the personality of your mod, however I will explain this a bit later.
        </p>

            Before you start learning more about how to set up your framework, make sure you've finished my modding introduction guide: <a href="https://yooksidoesminecraft.blogspot.de/2016/08/getting-started-with-minecraft-modding.html">Getting Started with Minecraft Modding</a>.
            Understanding basic concepts being discussed there and getting the actual development environment operational, is an elementary requirement to completing this guide.

        <!--We're also going to be interacting with GitHub a lot, so I suggest checking out another article I wrote about learning to work with GitHub: <a href="https://yooksidoesminecraft.blogspot.de/2016/10/learning-to-github-for-minecraft-modders.html">Learning to GitHub: For Minecraft Modders</a>. It will give you a beginners understanding of what GitHub is, how it works and why it's important for us Minecraft modders. Note that this step is optional, but highly recommended.-->

        <h2>Structuring Your Mod</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            We’ll look at how to organize your mod into different files and what those files should do. This section will be partially based on an official Forge <a href="https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/structuring/" target="_blank">article</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike in my previous guide, this time we will be setting up a mod project from scratch. To do this we will use <b>Eclipse</b> as our IDE. If you prefer another development environment and are asking yourself why I insist on using Eclipse,
            it's mainly because it's the most popular IDE out there, and most developers already have experience working with it.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Project</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Your first step should be to create a new workspace folder in an easily accessible location, like <code>Libraries\Documents</code>. Name the folder any way you want. This is where Eclipse will store it's metadata files related to Java projects
            created and managed inside that workspace. These files will be hosted in two folders called <code class="black">.metadata</code> and <code class="black">.recommenders</code>, so don't mess around with those folders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now open Eclipse and select the new folder you just created as your workspace directory. You should have been prompted to selected your workspace by Eclipse launcher. In case this didn't happen, do this - <code class="UI">File → Switch Workspace → Other...</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we're going to create a new Java project - <code class="UI">File → New → Java Project</code>. This will open a new window with several different options. First and foremost, give the project a cool name, something like: <code>"best-minecraft-mod-ever"</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="note-header">Note</div>
        <div class="note-body">
            When choosing a name for your project, use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces. This is a commonly accepted repository naming convention in the GitHub community, and that's important because later on we will be turning this project into a Git repository.
        </div>
        <p>
            Select the latest JavaSE as your execution environment JRE (version 1.8 at the moment of writing this article). If you're interested in developing for older versions of Minecraft, you have to find out which execution environment that specific version
            uses, and select that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modify the project layout, by selecting the <code class="UI">Create separate folders for sources and class files</code> option. This option will instruct Eclipse to build the project from a dedicated folder containing your code and other resources.
            We need to create two source folders for this project: <code>src/main/java</code> and <code>src/main/resources</code>. The first folder will hold the main code, while the second one will hold model files, textures and other similar files.
            To specify a default source folder to use when creating new projects, click the <code class="UI">Configure default</code> link and enter the name of the first source folder. Click next and <img class="icon" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yooksi/Generic-Mod/gh-pages/images/source_folder.png"
                style="padding: 0;" /> create the second source folder. Click finish and your basic structure is now complete.
        </p>
        <h3>Packages</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            We're going to be organizing our classes by placing them in packages. In case you don't understand what Java packages are, I strongly recommend reading this short Java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/index.html"
                target="_blank">tutorial</a>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <div class="quotesign">“</div>
            A package is a grouping of related types providing access protection and name space management. Note that types refers to classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Pick a unique package name. The conventional naming scheme starts with your name, followed by the name of your mod like this <code>mandy.amazingmod</code>. However, if you own a URL associated with your project, you can use it as your top
            level package. For example if you own the “example.com”, you may use <code>com.example</code> as your top level package.
        </p>
        <div class="note-header">Note</div>
        <div class="note-body">
            The commonly accepted package naming convention is to define all names in <b>lower case</b> to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.
        </div>
        <p>
            Once you've decided on a good name, create the top level package with that name. Now we're going to create two package within the top level package you just created by using a common sub-package strategy recommended by Forge. All code run on server/client
            should be placed in <code>common</code> package, and client side only code in <code>client</code> package.
        </p>
        <p>
            By keeping your code in clean sub-packages, you can grow your mod much more organically.
        </p>

        We will begin by defining a framework entry point with the @Mod annotation. Any class found with this annotation applied will be loaded as a Mod. The instance that is loaded will represent the mod to other Mods in the system.
