# Generic-Mod
An example project designed to teach you how to create your first Minecraft 1.10 mod.  
It's intended to be used with this moddding guide: [Getting Started With Minecraft Modding](https://yooksidoesminecraft.blogspot.de/2016/08/getting-started-with-minecraft-modding.html).

At the moment this mod only contains a mod framework that should be enough to let your start writing your own code.  
_The reason `build.gradle` is not included in this project is because you are expected to create one as a learning experience._
